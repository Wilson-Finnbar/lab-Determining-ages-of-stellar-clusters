	abstract = {{We present results of K(22 μm) band photometry of stars in the globular cluster M13 (NGC 6205), reaching to some 2 mag below the main-sequence turn-off, which we combine with previously published optical photometry to produce optical--infrared colour--magnitude diagrams. A comparison of these with a sequence of five subdwarfs of known parallax has enabled us to determine a distance modulus for M13 of 14.27$\pm$0.05 mag without Lutz--Kelker corrections, or 14.44$\pm$0.06 mag if full Lutz--Kelker corrections are included.We have measured the colour of the main-sequence turn-off to be (V--K) = 1.20 mag, and by assuming a realistic gravity for the turn-off, we have used model atmosphere calculations to convert this to a temperature of (6260$\pm$100) K.From simulations made with theoretical isochrone calculations, we have determined the sensitivity of the distances derived from different colour--magnitude planes to various sources of error. We find that, at worst, combining optical with infrared magnitudes of equivalent photometric accuracy enables temperatures to be determined with much greater accuracy, and gives a photometrically independent contribution to the isochrone and subdwarf fits. At best, it gives the above and also offers isochrone and subdwarf fits which are more stable against errors in the photometry, the isochrones or in the adopted reddening parameters.}},

	abstract = {{We present the results from VI CCD time-series photometry of the globular cluster M13 (NGC 6205). From the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of RRab and RRc stars we found an average metallicity of [Fe/H]zw  = −1.58 $\pm$ 0.09. The distance to the cluster was estimated as 7.1 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc from independent methods related to the variable star families RR Lyrae, SX Phe and W Virginis, from the luminosity of the theoretical ZAHB and from the orbit solution of a newly discovered contact binary star. The RR Lyrae pulsation modes are segregated by the red edge of the first overtone instability strip in this OoII-type cluster. A membership analysis of 52 800 stars in the field of the cluster is presented based on Gaia-DR2 proper motions which enabled the recognition of 23 070 likely cluster members, for 7630 of which we possess VI photometry. The identification of member stars allowed the construction of a clean CMD and a proper ZAHB and isochrone fitting, consistent with a reddening, age and distance of 0.02 mag, 12.6 Gyr and 7.1 kpc, respectively. We report seven new variables: one RRc, two SX Phe stars, three SR and one contact binary. V31 presents double-mode nature and we confirm V36 as RRd. 15 variable star candidates are also reported. The analysis of 18 stars in the field of the cluster, reported as RR Lyrae from the Gaia-DR2 data base, reveals that at least seven are not variable. We noted the presence of a high-velocity star in the field of the cluster.}},

	abstract = {We present deep CCD photometry of the globular cluster M13 (NGC 6205) in the Str{\"o}mgren uvbyβ system and determine a foreground reddening of E(b-y)=0.015$\pm$0.01 mag. From a fit to the main sequence of metal-poor subdwarfs with Hipparcos parallaxes, we derive (m-M)0=14.38$\pm$0.10, which implies an age near 12 Gyr assuming [Fe/H] = -1.61 and [α/Fe] = 0.3. The distance-independent [(b-y)0, c0] diagram indicates that M13 and metal-poor field subdwarfs of similar metallicity must be coeval to within $\pm$1 Gyr. In addition, we find that, at any given (b-y)0 color, there is a large spread in the c0 index for M13 red giant branch (RGB) stars. We suspect that this scatter, which extends at least as faint as the base of the RGB, is most likely due to star-to-star variations in the atmospheric abundances of the CNO elements. We also note the existence of what appears to be two separate stellar populations on the horizontal branch of M13. Among other possibilities, it could arise as the result of differences in the extent to which deep mixing occurs in the precursor red giants.},

@article{VandenBerg_2013,
	abstract = {Ages have been derived for 55 globular clusters (GCs) for which Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys photometry is publicly available. For most of them, the assumed distances are based on fits of theoretical zero-age horizontal-branch (ZAHB) loci to the lower bound of the observed distributions of HB stars, assuming reddenings from empirical dust maps and metallicities from the latest spectroscopic analyses. The age of the isochrone that provides the best fit to the stars in the vicinity of the turnoff (TO) is taken to be the best estimate of the cluster age. The morphology of isochrones between the TO and the beginning part of the subgiant branch (SGB) is shown to be nearly independent of age and chemical abundances. For well-defined color--magnitude diagrams (CMDs), the error bar arising just from the ``fitting'' of ZAHBs and isochrones is ≈ $\pm$ 0.25 Gyr, while that associated with distance and chemical abundance uncertainties is ∼ $\pm$ 1.5--2 Gyr. The oldest GCs in our sample are predicted to have ages of ≈13.0 Gyr (subject to the aforementioned uncertainties). However, the main focus of this investigation is on relative GC ages. In conflict with recent findings based on the relative main-sequence fitting method, which have been studied in some detail and reconciled with our results, ages are found to vary from mean values of ≈12.5 Gyr at [Fe/H]  ≲   − 1.7 to ≈11 Gyr at [Fe/H] ≳ −1. At intermediate metallicities, the age--metallicity relation (AMR) appears to be bifurcated: one branch apparently contains clusters with disk-like kinematics, whereas the other branch, which is displaced to lower [Fe/H] values by ≈0.6 dex at a fixed age, is populated by clusters with halo-type orbits. The dispersion in age about each component of the AMR is ∼ $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr. There is no apparent dependence of age on Galactocentric distance (RG) nor is there a clear correlation of HB type with age. As previously discovered in the case of M3 and M13, subtle variations have been found in the slope of the SGB in the CMDs of other metal-poor ([Fe/H]  ≲   − 1.5) GCs. They have been tentatively attributed to cluster-to-cluster differences in the abundance of helium. Curiously, GCs that have relatively steep ``M13-like'' SGBs tend to be massive systems, located at small RG, that show the strongest evidence of in situ formation of multiple stellar populations. The clusters in the other group are typically low-mass systems (with 2--3 exceptions, including M3) that, at the present time, should not be able to retain the matter lost by mass-losing stars due either to the development of GC winds or to ram-pressure stripping by the halo interstellar medium. The apparent separation of the two groups in terms of their present-day gas retention properties is difficult to understand if all GCs were initially ∼20 times their current masses. The lowest-mass systems, in particular, may have never been massive enough to retain enough gas to produce a significant population of second-generation stars. In this case, the observed light element abundance variations, which are characteristic of all GCs, were presumably present in the gas out of which the observed cluster stars formed.},

@article{Paust_2010,
	abstract = {We have used observations obtained as part of the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters to construct global present-day mass functions for 17 globular clusters utilizing multi-mass King models to extrapolate from our observations to the global cluster behavior. The global present-day mass functions for these clusters are well matched by power laws from the turnoff, ≈0.8 M☉, to 0.2--0.3 M☉ on the lower main sequence. The slopes of those power-law fits, α, have been correlated with an extensive set of intrinsic and extrinsic cluster properties to investigate which parameters may influence the form of the present-day mass function. We do not confirm previous suggestions of correlations between α and either metallicity or Galactic location. However, we do find a strong statistical correlation with the related parameters central surface brightness, μV, and inferred central density, ρ0. The correlation is such that clusters with denser cores (stronger binding energy) tend to have steeper mass functions (a higher proportion of low-mass stars), suggesting that dynamical evolution due to external interactions may have played a key role in determining α. Thus, the present-day mass function may owe more to nurture than to nature. Detailed modeling of external dynamical effects is therefore a requisite for determining the initial mass function for Galactic globular clusters.},

	abstract = {We present high-precision V, B-V color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for the classic second-parameter globular clusters M3 and M13 from wide-field, deep CCD photometry. The data for the two clusters were obtained during the same photometric nights with the same instrument, allowing us to determine accurate relative ages. Based on a differential comparison of the CMDs using the Δ(B-V) method, an age difference of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 Gyr is obtained between these two clusters. We compare this result with our updated horizontal-branch (HB) population models, which confirm that the observed age difference can produce the difference in HB morphology between the clusters. This provides further evidence that age is the dominant second parameter that influences HB morphology.},
